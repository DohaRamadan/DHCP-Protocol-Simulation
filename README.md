# DHCP-Protocol-Simulation
A project for Computer Networks Technology course in Cairo University - Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence. 

## Description
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters 
to devices connected to the network using a clientâ€“server architecture. The project is a simulation of how the DHCP protocol works including how to the client asks for an IP address and how the server assigns IP addresses to each client. 

## Tools Used:
